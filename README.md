# Twitter_graphing_python
Code to pull tweets from twitter API and graph in NetworkX & Gephi.

This code is part of a presentation to the Ottawa Pycoders Meetup on August 27, 2015.

Use: 

run search_twitter_to_json with args: -q QUERY -c COUNT/PULSE -m MAX TWEETS

Then run the Twitter NX User Graph.ipynb to set up the graph and export to Gephi.

Then open, Gephi, load up your file and play!
